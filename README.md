## Summary

Most users are younger men who commute from home to work or school during weekdays. 
Additional visualizations that could help in future analysis could be a visualization to show which types of bike are used the most (mountain, street bike, etc.) 
and a visualization that shows a heat map for street data, showing which streets are used the most and why. Are these streets uphill? downhill? wide? important questions for bike riding.
